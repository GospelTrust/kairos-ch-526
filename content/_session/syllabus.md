## Course Description

This is a survey of the history of the church from the Reformation to the modern church.
This course will give students a broad and practical view of the church and our heritage as
Protestants. We will appreciate the growth of the church, its struggles, and the highs and
lows of an exceptionally long story. The focus here is not on names, dates, and places—but
on the story of the church. The story of those Christians who went before us.

   2. Students who are absent from any Zoom classes will need to watch the recorded Zoom video located on the Classe365 portal submit a two-page summary of: what were the topics discussed and answer at least two of the discussion questions that were presented in the Zoom class. These summaries are to be emailed to the TA before the next Zoom session.  Students who do so will receive credit for the Zoom session. Students will only be allowed to write a summary for two of the six classes, after that, there will be no credit given.

2. Attendance Component of the Grade / Penalties for Missed Classes:

<sub>Section VI</sub>
## Academic Integrity / Plagiarism

### Doing Your Own Work.

Students are required to do their own work. Group study and review sessions are fine and are encouraged. But when completing an assignment or writing a paper, students must do their own work. Similarly, when taking a quiz or an exam, whether in the classroom or online, students are to do their own work.

Do not use Artificial Intelligence (AI) enhanced Large Language Model apps (i.e., ChatGPT, Google Bard, etc.). Students are to do their own work and write their own papers; they are not to use apps with AI enhanced chatbot such as ChatGPT. If papers are submitted using apps such as ChatGPT, at the professor's discretion, the student may be required to redo the paper (perhaps for a reduced grade) or will receive a zero on the paper.

> Kairos University utilizes AI detection App to check for AI augmented papers.

### "Closed Book" Quizzes and Exams.

If a quiz or exam is "closed book," students are to take it without the aid of their Bible, any books, reference works, or notes. [Professors will designate whether an exam is closed book, or whether students may use their Bibles or notes, etc.] Using notes or other materials when taking a quiz or exam that is "closed book" constitutes cheating.

### Proper Attribution / Plagiarism.

For term papers & research papers, it is expected that students will read and use multiple sources. When referring to information that is commonly known, footnotes are not needed. However, if students use detailed information drawn from a specific source, they must give credit to that author; in specific, they must identify the book, author, and page # of the source. If failure to do so is an honest oversight, as a minimum, it will reduce the grade of a paper. But if a student passes off research done by another person as his or her own work, that is plagiarism, which is a serious violation of academic integrity.

### Consequences for Violations of Academic Integrity:

In the case of a violation any of the above, at the discretion of the professor and the Academic Dean of Kairos University, based on the seriousness of the violation, any of the following consequences may be imposed:
- The student may be required to re-accomplish the work or exam in question, or to complete a designated alternate assignment; such work will receive a maximum grade of "C".
- The student will not be given an opportunity to re-accomplish the work and will receive an "F" for the work in question. This may result in the student receiving a grade of "F" for the course.

For repeated violations of academic integrity in more than one course, a student may be dismissed from the university.
